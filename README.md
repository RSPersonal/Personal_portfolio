<b>Homepage</b>  
Building the homepage was not that hard, but when i needed to integrate Postgresql, I hit a wall and could not figure out how to do it. After extensive searching and reading documentation I was able to create and connect the database both in production and locally. Next goals was to give the user the functionality to view the resume in both Dutch and English. 

<b>API Projects</b>  
Here I want to showcase that iam able to connect to an external API and retreive data to showcase on my page. 

<b>Database Projects</b>  
This is my main section to showcase projects like the stocktracker. I learned a lot from this section but mostly unittesting, catching exceptions, getting database instances, correct variable naming, connecting own REST api, connecting to external api etc.
