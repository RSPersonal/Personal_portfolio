        <h2>
            Keyword finder
        </h2>
        <p>
            A tool to find certain keywords in .txt file. I wrote this tool because at some point I needed to find
            certain
            keywords in a (sometimes long) class file. Instead of manually looking through the whole code I wrote this
            script to find these
            keywords and write them out in txt file or show direct in browser.
